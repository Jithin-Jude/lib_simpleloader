# Simpleloader
For the past few years, I was using Lottie for showing both loading & other custom animations. Even tho Lottie is providing cooler animations, one major issue I was facing was that the Lottie files are not doing well in terms of performance.

So here is a simple, lightweight, easy-to-use library for showing a simple native loader when the app is doing heavy background tasks & network calls.
